What works:

What doesnt work:

*Note! 
run-all.sh needs to be updated for project 3 testing*

To test all test cases:
./run-all.sh
This will produce a diff.res file, which will append all of the output from diff. diff.res is cleared automatically and produced automatically if it doesnt exist each time the script is run.
